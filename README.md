# RazorHack CTF 2024 - Format Frenzy
#### Created by Alex Prosser

> Oh, thank goodness you are here. An intern downloaded a virus while trying to fix the breakroom computer (to think that "Totally Real Anti-Virus 2034" would not be what it seems). We managed to recover most of the data, but we have some files that got scrubbed of all the metadata! We will have some of our team members try to remember what the data is, but can you investigate the files to see WHAT you can find?
~ IT Team

The flags will take the structure of `flag{FLAG_HERE_XXXXX}`.

### 1. Graphics mean *Everything*

> I think this file came from the boss's recent vacation, so I WOULD treat with the upmost respect and totally not post it in the Teams chat afterwards...
~ Stanley from IT

### 2. Plastic, amirite?

> If I remember correctly, this may be from an instruction set of some kind, but I can't put MY finger on it...
~ Sven from IT

Note: please keep all characters lowercase and wrap `flag{}` around it 

### 3. My zipper got stuck :(

> Oi oi oi, I reckon if we can crack into this bugger, we can find the true meaning of life. I'm just ribbing ya, but if my NAME isn't Alfred the III Jr., you can fix this in a jiffy...
~ Alfred from IT

### 4. Additive Manufacturing in my Office?!?!

> I really need this file to BE recovered as I have all my money in this business that specializes in creating custom parts for office desks and if this file is lost, I will lose millions!!!
~ John from IT

### 5. Homemade Code Right Here

> My mom apparently sent this to me with the message, "I wanted to do something that you would be familiar with, but you technologies are too complicated. I am happy though that I made it from Scratch, so IF you like it, please call back." Maybe recover this for some happy thoughts... 
~ Justin from IT

### 6. Son, Git in here!

> So, it turns out that our website build was also in the files that got wiped, but we really need to get that back or else we have to start over, and we made so progress on our FIRST build that we really don't want to do that...
~ Sven from IT

### 7. Back in the 80s...

> I remember when I was a wee lad back in 1988 when I got into developement of my first game console, but my old age has made me forget the name. This file maybe has LETTERS of my first game, but I'm not for sure... 
~ Alfred from IT

### 8. I'm Not Taking This Litely

> This malware seemed to have corrupted everything! First our website build, now our database! How are we going to produce state-of-the-art technologies if everything is gone. We WERE going to restart, but maybe you can help again...
~ John from IT

### 9. In both Magnitude and Direction

> This seems to be from some sort of vector processing unit, but it isn't from anything modern. However, our version of the arcade game Asteroids that we keep in the break room seems to be SWITCHED with a toaster, and I can't help to think those are related...
~ Justin from IT

### 10. Under Lock and Key

> This last file is really important, and we have identified it... but it seems that the malware specifically targetted it and locked it under out noses. That pesky intern said, "The malware seemed to PASSWORD-encode the file and placed a riddle around to figure it out". Can you help us one last time?
